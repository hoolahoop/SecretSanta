Conclusions:
1. The maximum amount of unsuitable persons that one person can have is the total amount of people in the group, minus two.
It's minus two because no one can have themselves, which reduces the list by one, and because everyone has to have at least
one person to be a santa for.
For 2 people: 2 - 2 = 0.
For 3 people: 3 - 2 = 1.
For 4 people: 4 - 2 = 2.
For 5 people: 5 - 2 = 3.

2. The maximum # of unsuitables has a formula of: max. amount of unsuitables for one person x # of people in the group.
For 2 people: 0 * 2 = 0.
For 3 people: 1 * 3 = 3.
For 4 people: 2 * 4 = 8.
For 5 people: 3 * 5 = 15.

3. The maximum amount that one person can be in people's unsuitable lists is the total amount of people in the group minus two.
For 2 people: 2 - 2 = 0.
For 3 people: 3 - 2 = 1.
For 4 people: 4 - 2 = 2.
For 5 people: 5 - 2 = 3.

4. The amount of times that one person can be on an unsuitable list is the total amount of the group minus 2.
For 2 people: 2 - 2 = 0.
For 3 people: 3 - 2 = 1.
For 4 people: 4 - 2 = 2.
For 5 people: 5 - 2 = 3.

5. The amount that all of the santas can choose one secret person. At least one santa has to be able to choose one secret 
person.



6. The amount of people that can choose one secret person. This number will be the group size minus 1, minus the amount of people
that have the secret person on their unsuitable list. The minimum this number can be is 1.
For 2 people: 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore 0 unsuitables.
For 3 people: 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore 1 unsuitables.

7. The amount of secret people that one santa can choose. This number will be the group size minus 1, minus the amount of people
on this person's unsuitable list.
